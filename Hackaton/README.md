Code: LLM6.py
The API used in this file for the LLM, is the free cohere large language model API. 

This code was the result of a Hackaton we did for UMC Utrecht.
The challenge was to make a program that automaticaly checks the TRIPOD-criteria with Academic Articles, to see if they are suitable for further medical research.
TRIPOD-criteria stands for: Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (Gary S. Collins,2015).
The Hackaton lasted for a week.
We first tried to develop our own Machine Learning model (in particular a Large Language Model), but because of the underwhelming results and limited time we decided to use an LLM Api instead called Cohere.

The file TRIPOD_rapport (14) is the result of the final program. TRIPOD_rapport (11-13) are files to show the improvements made, so those are relatively irrelevant.
