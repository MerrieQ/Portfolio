**The Home Invaders – Smart Home Energy Monitoring Prototype**

File: tEST Copy1223.zip

This project was developed as part of a data-driven startup concept during a minor. The idea was to build a smart home system that focuses on energy consumption tracking, reducing unnecessary electricity use, and ensuring privacy for the user. 

The prototype was created using Arduino (C/C++) and simulated in Wokwi. No Python was used in this project.

**Getting Started**
To test the prototype, you’ll need an Arduino simulation environment (e.g. Wokwi) or a physical Arduino board (e.g. Uno or Nano).

**Prerequisites**
- Arduino IDE or Wokwi.com (browser-based)
- Required components (see diagram.json):
  - Current sensor
  - LEDs
  - Display module (if applicable)
  

**Installation**
1. Open the file sketch.ino in your Arduino IDE or upload it to Wokwi.
2. Refer to diagram.json to understand the breadboard wiring and component setup.
3. Verify and upload the sketch to the Arduino board, or simulate using Wokwi.
4. Install libraries listed in libraries.txt.

**Usage**
The prototype monitors energy consumption (simulated), responds with LED signals, and optionally triggers other events such as alerts or simulated automation. It's meant to demonstrate the concept of local energy optimization and transparent feedback to the user.

**Project Context**
This code was part of a group project under the name “The Home Invaders.” It accompanied a broader smart-home system concept focused on:
- Real-time energy tracking
- Recommendations for energy saving
- Privacy-first data handling
