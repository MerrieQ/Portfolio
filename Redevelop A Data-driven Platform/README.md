Redevelop a Data-driven Platform

_Because of the new restrictions of the Spotify API that were added in November 2024, the code sadly doesnt work anymore. Spotify restricted the acces of alot of features like characteristics of a song, song recommendations, and algorithmic playlist generation._

I redevelopped the "Blend" playlist function in Spotify, which combines music tastes into one playlist for two people.
