**Programming Portfolio**

This is my programming portfolio, which contains all the code I developed while attending the minor Big Data & Design at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (Hogeschool Utrecht). The minor consisted of 10 EC in Data-Driven Technical courses (completed with a grade of 8), and 20 EC in Data-Driven Design courses (completed with a grade of 7).

This repository includes work primarily written in Python, covering: data wrangling, data analysis, data collection, data visualisation, big data processing, machine learning, and working with APIs. It also includes minimal programming in C/C++, which I used for a small Arduino prototype.

The repository is structured into four main projects. Each project has its own folder containing the relevant files:

**Datastory**

For this project, I created a data story about the return of the wolf in the Netherlands. The presentation explores the controversy and differing opinions surrounding the wolf's reappearance. I used datasets on wolf sightings and livestock attacks, both sourced from BIJ12 (an organization supporting Dutch provinces with data and knowledge for environmental and nature management under the IPO). Through geocoding, I created an interactive map with a timeline showing the locations and frequency of attacks.

Relevant skills: Data Collection, Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation, Big Data Processing

**Hackathon**

I participated in a one-week hackathon organized as part of the minor. The challenge was to develop a tool that automatically checks academic articles against the TRIPOD criteria (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis – Gary S. Collins, 2015) to assess their suitability for medical research. Initially, we attempted to develop our own machine learning model, specifically a large language model (LLM). However, due to limited training data and time constraints, we opted to use an external LLM API, provided by Cohere.

Relevant skills: Machine Learning, Working with APIs

**Redesigning a Data-Driven Platform**

Due to new restrictions introduced by the Spotify API in November 2024, many features—such as access to song characteristics, recommendations, and algorithmically generated playlists—became unavailable. As a result, the original codebase is no longer functional.

In this project, I rebuilt Spotify's “Blend” feature, which generates a shared playlist for two users by combining their music preferences. Users could customize the playlist based on genres and whether they preferred familiar or new music.

Relevant skills: Working with APIs

**Data-Driven Startup**

In a team project, we developed a data-driven startup concept called The Home Invaders. The concept focused on a smart-home system designed to reduce energy consumption while prioritizing user privacy. Although Python was not used, we created a prototype using Arduino. The prototype simulated the connection process of a smart outlet, initially intended to use an NFC chip but later adapted to use a proximity sensor due to limited resources.

Relevant skills: C/C++, JSON
