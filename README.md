# Portfolio
Here my programming/coding portfolio, it contains all my work i coded while attending the minor "Big Data & Design" at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (Hogeschool Utrecht). This Minor contained 10 EC of Data Driven Technical lessons (which i finished with an 8), and 20 EC of Data Driven Design lessons (which i finished with a 7).

This respiratory contains coding in python, in particular: Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, Data Collecting, Data Visualisation, Big Data Processing, Machine Learning and working with API's. It also contains minimal coding with C/C++, which i coded for a small Arduino project.

This respiratory contains 4 projects i made. To seperate all the relevant files, you can select the relevant folders:


**Datastory:**

I made a data story about the wolf returning to the Netherlands. It is a presentation about the controversy and split opinion about the wolf. I used datasets about sightings of the wolf, and about the attacks (on animals) by the wolf. First I used 2 datasets from "BIJ12" (BIJ12 supports Dutch provinces with data and knowledge for nature and environmental management under IPO). I used Geocoding to make an interactive map, with a timeline containing the locations of the attacks and the frequency.

Relevant skills: Data Collection, Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Data Visualisation and Big Data Processing.


**Hackaton:**

I participated in a Hackaton with the minor. The challenge was to make a program that automaticaly checks the TRIPOD-criteria with Academic Articles, to see if they are suitable for further medical research. TRIPOD-criteria stands for: Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (Gary S. Collins,2015). The Hackaton lasted for a week.
We first tried to develop our own Machine Learning model (in particular a Large Language Model), but because of the underwhelming results (not enough training material) and limited time we decided to use an LLM Api instead called Cohere.

Relevant Skills: Machine Learning and working with API's.


**Redevelop a Data-driven Platform:**

_Because of the new restrictions of the Spotify API that were added in November 2024, the code sadly doesnt work anymore. Spotify restricted the acces of alot of features like characteristics of a song, song recommendations, and algorithmic playlist generation._

I redeveloped the "Blend" playlist function in Spotify, which combines music tastes into one playlist for two people. Characteristics like genre, new or known-by-users music were customisable. 

Relevant skills: Working with API's


**Data-driven Startup:**
I designed a new data-driven startup concept with a group from the minor, called "The Home Invaders". It was a smart-home system, focussed on energy-consumption (and reduction), and privacy. 
We did'nt use any Python code, only a small Arduino project we used as a prototype.

Relevant skills: C/C++, JSON.
