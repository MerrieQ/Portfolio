"OLD CODE" is relevant for the data wrangling, collection, analysis, cleaning and big data.
I converted all the work with the data to CSV Files, and moved it to a new code, to make sure that everytime i run the code, all the data wrangling analysis and cleaning didn't repeat and made the runtime alot slower.
